# Python-Car-image_video_url-Object-Detection-YOLOv3
<p>Python Car Object Detection YOLOv3 is an implementation of the YOLOv3 object detection algorithm using the Python programming language. This implementation is specifically designed for detecting cars in images and videos.

The YOLOv3 object detection algorithm utilizes a neural network to classify and localize objects in images or videos. It works by dividing the input image into a grid and making predictions on each grid cell to detect objects.

Python Car Object Detection YOLOv3 allows for the detection and classification of cars in images and videos using a pre-trained YOLOv3 model. It can identify the location and bounding boxes around detected cars, as well as provide classification of car types if the model is trained for such a task.

This implementation enables developers and researchers to leverage the power of the YOLOv3 algorithm for car detection in their Python-based projects.<br/><br/>
